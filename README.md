1. Use regression techniques—including linear regression, ridge and lasso 
regularization, decision tree regression, ensemble methods (e.g., random forest), 
Support Vector Regression (SVR) and KNN. Estimate: 
1. Identify which factors significantly impact tip amounts.
2. Prediction Accuracy: Build and evaluate models to forecast tips effectively.
3. Insights for Management: Provide actionable insights to improve customer 
service strategies and revenue management.
2. Check if the data follows a linear trend using following methods to analyze the 
relationship between the target variable and predictors. 
• Scatter Plot
• Pair Plot for Multiple Features
• Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)
• Statistical Tests for Linearity (Rainbow Test)
• Residuals Plot
• Line Plot (for time-series data)
• Based on the trend in data apply suitable regression method and check 
model prediction accuracy
